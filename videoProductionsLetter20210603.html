		<h2>Letter solicited by Mr. Walsh</h2>

		<p>First: development needs to be finished on Mia. I hope to get to v1.0 by the start of next school year, but certainly by second semester. Mia will have a positive effect on so many different aspects of life; having her will increase others' trust and therefore my intel-gathering capabilities.</p>

		<p>Second: improve as a human. Learn Morse code, work on supressing visible emotion, improve decition-making capabilities, get better at reading other people, improve physically, etc. Hopefully this can be done by the end of senior year. The importance is self-explanatory here; I'd just like to be more useful to myself.</p>

		<p>Third: Ash. [Codename for confiditiality purposes.] Ash sould be established certainly before 2030, but as that is also a different deadline, it would be ideal if this could happen before then. Ash is important for our comfort and survival, and the latter may well not be acheived without it. I worry that motivation will be lost as the Unfortunate Number increases in size, as that is what has been observed in other settings, but it is vital that this does not happen. I therefore think it prudent to work on Ash continuously, even before it can be fully implemented, since when something is being actively worked on it appears more exciting and important. I worry that if I do not do work continuously, it will fade away as a priority. Watch burnout though.</p>

		<p>Also, I-29 would be nice; how's that going? However, don't prioritize acheiving this too much over more important things. Once it is acheived, though, maintaining it ought to become a greater priority than acheiving it was.</p>
